# budgeting-cli-tool
A Terminal/Command Prompt function setup to store data from purchases (date, item name, and cost) and perform basic analysis on that data
Make the function usable by sourcing the funtion file in your startup file (such as .bashrc) with the command "source pathToFile"
After that, do budgeting --help to get started!
